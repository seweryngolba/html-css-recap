        I've paid my dues
        Time after time
        I've done my sentence
        But committed no crime
        And bad mistakes
        I've made a few
        I've had my share of sand
        Kicked in my face
        But I've come through

        And we mean to go on and on and on and on

        We are the champions, my friends
        And we'll keep on fighting till the end
        We are the champions
        We are the champions
        No time for losers
        'Cause we are the champions of the World

        I've taken my bows
        And my curtain calls
        You brought me fame and fortune
        And everything that goes with it
        I thank you all
        But it's been no bed of roses
        No pleasure cruise
        I consider it a challenge before
        The human race
        And I ain't gonna lose

        And we mean to go on and on and on and on

        We are the champions, my friends
        And we'll keep on fighting till the end
        We are the champions
        We are the champions
        No time for losers
        'Cause we are the champions of the World

        We are the champions, my friends
        And we'll keep on fighting till the end
        We are the champions
        We are the champions
        No time for losers
        'Cause we are the champions of the World
